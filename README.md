## Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px" height="25px">

### Introduction

I'm Igor, a data engineer and python developer with a background in electrical engineering. I am currently working on the following:
- During working hours, I create a domain agnostic conversational AI agent. Solve core NLP problems like semantics, similarity, and intent classification using SpaCy and simCSE tools. 
- Days and nights, most of my free time I work on various BCIs, currently, I am working on BCI inner speech recognition system. And the ultimate goal is to integrate BCI with a RaspberryPi-based robot.
- During tea breaks, I develop a full-fledged API using FastAPI.
